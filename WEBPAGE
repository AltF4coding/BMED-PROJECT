      <h1>Engineer the Lift!</h1>
      <p>This simulation helps you explore exercise risks and bioengineered solutions for people with physical disabilities. Select a condition (e.g., amputation, Parkinson's, partial paralysis), identify risky exercises, and evaluate the best bioengineering response: avoid the activity, isolate a limb, or use a prosthetic or assistive device.</p>
      <p>Use the options below to test your decisions and learn how to adapt equipment and training safely and effectively for individual needs. BMED engineering tells us that treating human disorders with creative, and individual solutions is the best method to help allow everyone to excel.</p>
      <h2>Background: Challenges in Inclusive Gym Design</h2>
      <p><strong>Biological Aspects:</strong> Individuals with disabilities often experience altered muscle coordination, joint loading, or range of motion, requiring careful consideration of biomechanics and physiology when designing safe workout routines.</p>
      <p><strong>Engineering Considerations:</strong> Conventional gym equipment is often symmetric, rigid, or assumes full limb mobility. Engineering adaptations like modular machines, adaptive grips, or smart feedback systems allow more inclusive and safer training.</p>
      <p><strong>Ecological/Societal Impact:</strong> Designing universally accessible exercise systems reduces inequality in fitness, enhances rehabilitation access, and encourages healthier lifestyles for all. It can also reduce long-term healthcare costs and promote independence.</p>
